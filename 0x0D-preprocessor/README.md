This project is about Preprocessors
    All preprocessor commands begins with the hash (pound) symbol # . A C macro is just a preprocessor command
    that is deÔ¨Åned using the #define preprocessor directive. During the preprocessing stage, the C preprocessor (a part
    of the C compiler) simply substitutes the body of the macro wherever its name appears.
